I got Ruby 3.2.2 installed by downgrading OpenSSL to v1.1

brew install openssl@1.1
brew list    # just to make sure we have it installed
brew unlink openssl@3
brew link openssl@1.1

# ...

openssl version
# OpenSSL 1.1.1u  30 May 2023

rvm install 3.2.2   # all good now! :)

I was reading this article and following step should solve the issue with ssl

brew install openssl@3
ruby-install 3.1.4 -- --with-openssl-dir=$(brew --prefix openssl@3)
chruby 3.1.4
