<b> Instructor:</b> Yuan Liu (q\_yuanliu@ncsu.edu)

<b> Time and Location:</b> Tue and Thur 11:45 am - 1:00 pm, 1226 EB2. The course is hosted on Moodle. Recorded lectures can be accessed on Panopto.

<b> Office hours:</b> 3-3:30 PM Tuesdays and 4-4:30 PM Wednesdays on Zoom.

<b> Objective or Description:</b> This course will introduce advanced topics of modern quantum algorithms and their applications in sciences and engineering including quantum chemistry, many-body physics, and classical mechanics. The goal is to help students develop intuition and skills to design new quantum algorithms for novel applications in the future. Both near-term and fault-tolerant quantum algorithms will be discussed although the course will focus more on fault-tolerant algorithms with provable speedups. A brief discussion on quantum algorithms based on continuous-variable systems (such as bosonic modes instead of qubits) will be presented toward the end of the course. As a special topic course, contents of the course will be drawn from recent literature. By the end of the course, students will develop a broad picture of the landscape of quantum algorithms research and how they can be used to solve important problems in physical sciences. Students will also learn how to quantify and analyze quantum algorithm complexity. Light hands-on numerical programming exercises will be given to ensure best understanding of the course materials. 


<b> Prerequisites:</b>  Linear algebra or signal processing.

<b> Learning Outcome: </b> Upon completion of this course, students will be able to: (1) Understanding and learn broadly topics in the field of quantum information science and engineering (QISE); (2) Develop a comprehensive quantum systems engineering perspective, connecting theory to devices to applications; (3) Apply QISE principles to general engineering disciplinaries to approach real-world problems


<b> Textbook and references:</b>
* No textbook required, weekly notes will be shared. See below for some standard references on quantum information science and engineering: 
* Quantum Computation and Quantum Information. Nielsen and Chuang
* Classical and Quantum Computation. Kitaev, Shen, and Vyalyi.
* Quantum Information Theory, Mark M. Wilde.
* Quantum Computing Since Democritus, Scott Aaronson.


<b> Topics: </b>
This course is organized into four major units:
* “Single-particle” quantum systems
* Multi-particle systems, entanglement
* Physical implementations of quantum systems
* Applications and resources needed for large-scale quantum computing systems

Specific topics include: motivation for quantum engineering, qubits and quantum gates, rules of quantum mechanics, mathematical background, quantum electrical circuits and other physical quantum systems, harmonic and anharmonic oscillators, measurement, the Schrödinger equation, noise, entanglement, benchmarking, quantum communication, and quantum algorithms. No prior experience with quantum mechanics is assumed.

The content of this course is meant to be accessible to undergraduate ECE and CSC students who have never before studied quantum mechanics. The lecture notes are derived from lectures given at MIT by Professors Karl Berggren, Isaac Chuang, Anand Natarajan, and Kevin O’Brien for an EECS undergraduate course with the same course name.
