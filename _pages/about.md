We are the Quantum Engineering and Simulation Theory (QuEST) group in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.ncsu.edu) and the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.csc.ncsu.edu) at NC State University in Raleigh, North Carolina. Our [research](/research/) aims at developing quantum-information-science-inspired algorithms and framework to tackle long-lasting challenges in physical sciences and engineering, with a focus on quantum algorithms and simulation, hybrid discrete-continuous-variable quantum information processing, and quantum engineering. 
**We have multiple Ph.D. positions available. We are always looking for motivated Master's and undergraduate students to join us. Interested students and scholars are encouraged to contact me.**

[//]: <> (I study quantum-classical algorithms to solve challenging problems in quantum chemistry, chemical physics, and material science, including correlated electronic structure and real-time dynamics. I also develop novel protocols to leverage continuous-variable quantum systems such as bosonic oscillators for computation, information processing, and sensing. Another topic of interest is how quantum error correction may be performed at a system or algorithm level. These topics are investigated from theoretical and computational perspectives, with possible experimental collaborations.)
