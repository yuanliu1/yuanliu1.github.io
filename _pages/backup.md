As an example, our recent <b>quantum bootstrap embedding</b> algorithm leverages small quantum computers to solve large electronic structure problems based on locality of quantum entanglement in molecules. State-of-the-art quantum subroutines such as swap test and amplitude amplification are exploited to achieve a quadratic speedup in quantum fragment quantum matching of the full reduced density matrices between subsystems.

We developed <b>fully coherent and efficient</b> quantum signal processing algorithms for real-time dynamics simulation with optimal query complexity. The resulting quantum algorithm is applied to Heisenberg model and molecules to demonstrate its utility for simulating femto-second electronic dynamics for the first time. The fully coherent nature of our algorithm allows it to serve as a subroutine that can be easily conctenated with other quantum algorithms.

We have developed a class of quantum Monte Carlo algorithms, i.e., finite-temperature auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (FT-AFQMC), to simulate ab initio finite temperature electronic structure of molecules and phase diagram of realistic solids in the grand canonical ensemble. This method is also generalized to the canonical ensemble, which enables calculation of properties of fixed-particle number systems.

<li><h4><b>Algorithmic-level Error Correction (ALEC)</b></h4></li>
We proposed a general theory for error-correction of quantum algorithms. Despite the simplicity of the error model, this is the first demonstration that error correction beyond quantum states and quantum gates is possible. Our theory uses redundancy in time, as opposed to using redundancy in space to control errors, which differs from existing protocols such as error correcting codes and error mitigation techniques.
