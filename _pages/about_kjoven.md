Ph.D. Student, Electrical and Computer Engineering, NC State

Kevin J. Joven is a Ph.D. student in Electrical & Electronics Engineering, focusing on the design and theory of new quantum algorithms and the study of control techniques for hybrid CV-DV architectures and their availability for new applications in quantum information science.  He is interested in possible applications in physical and chemical systems using symmetry aspects of the systems. Also, the implementation of QEC codes for CV-DV systems.
