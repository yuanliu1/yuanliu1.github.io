#### Dr. Younes Javanmard

Research Scholar at NC State

Younes Javanmard earned his Ph.D. from the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems and TU Dresden, where he worked on the quantum information aspects of strongly correlated many-body systems and developed state-of-the-art numerical techniques such as tensor networks, Monte Carlo methods, and related approaches. He has industry experience as a machine learning engineer, working on reinforcement learning, deep learning, and graph neural networks, as well as quantum algorithms, quantum optimization, and scientific software development. He was a postdoctoral researcher at Quantum Valley Lower Saxony and Leibniz University Hannover in the Quantum Information and Quantum Optics groups, focusing on digital quantum simulation of quantum many-body systems. His research interest is in applied quantum information and computation, specifically, in hybrid quantum devices. [Email](mailto:javanmard.younes@gmail.com)
