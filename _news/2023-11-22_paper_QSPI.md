Our paper on [Single-shot quantum signal processing interferometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13703) is posted on arXiv, where we proposed a general algorithmic framework, quantum signal processing interferometry (QSPI), for quantum sensing at the fundamental limits of quantum mechanics, i.e., the Heisenberg sensing limit, by generalizing Ramsey-type interferometry.
