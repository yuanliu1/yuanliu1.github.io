After working on it for more than 4 years, our Tutorial titled [Hybrid Oscillator-Qubit Quantum Processors: Instruction Set Architectures, Abstract Machine Models, and Applications](https://doi.org/10.1103/4rf7-9tfx) is finally accepted to **PRX Quantum**! 

This *mega piece* has 163 pages, 52 figures, and 714 references, and is a result of an excellent collaboration across NC State, Yale, MIT, Brookhaven National Lab, U Toronto, PNNL, and U Wisconsin-Madison! 

Thanks Prof. Steven Girvin for leading this and all the team members for their contribution!
