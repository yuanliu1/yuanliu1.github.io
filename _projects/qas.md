description: We are interested in efficient, scalable, and robust simulation of complex physical and chemical processes on quantum computers. This line of research will elucidate the intricate interplay between correlated electronic, vibrational, and dissipative processes that underpins fundamental aspects of chemistry and physics. Targeting applications include microscopic mechanisms of photosynthetic processes, quantum material design, and chemical reaction pathways in complex systems.
