title: Quantum Electrical and Computer Engineering
description: <h6> </h6>Theories and protocols in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) have been developed largely based on intuitions from classical physics. As quantum devices and signals play increasingly important roles, QIS will be indispensable to the emerging field of Quantum ECE. We are interested in investigating possible quantum advantages brought by QIS in a variety of topics including sensing/metrology/decision-making, mixed analog-digital quantum signal processing, and computer architecture.

<h3><b>Quantum Sensing and Metrology</b></h3>
We generalized quantum signal processing from spin dynamics to continuous-variable systems, and use it to design algorithmic quantum sensing protocols at the fundamental limit of quantum mechanics, which can ``steer" the quantum sensor's state tailored to the underlying signal of interest.

<h3><b>Mixed Analog-Digital Quantum Signal Processing</b></h3>

The hallmark of digital signal processing is Fourier transform and filter design. Envisioning a quantum future with an increasing demand of processing quantum signals and data, we seek to harness the power of quantum systems and computers for signal processing in the mixed digital-analog fashion.
